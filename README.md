* ****
* **Outline**
 
	This project highlights some major outbreaks / diseases since the year 2000 and provides a means to visualize and compare between eachother.
	

* ****
* **Purpose** 
	
	My hypothesis was that COVID 19 was not as detrimental to the population in comparison to other diseases spread
since the year 2000 in terms of deaths... So I found data to either prove or disprove it.
